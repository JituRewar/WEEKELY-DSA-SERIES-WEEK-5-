### Day 7 — LeetCode 100: Same Tree

**Problem (brief):** Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same. Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

**Approach:** Use recursion to compare corresponding nodes of both trees. At each step:

* If both nodes are `nullptr`, they are the same (return `true`).
* If one is `nullptr` and the other isn't, return `false`.
* If both are non-null, compare `val` and recursively check left and right subtrees.

**Time Complexity:** O(min(n, m)) — where n and m are the number of nodes in the two trees; in the worst case both trees have the same size, so O(n).

**Space Complexity:** O(h) due to recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree.

**Files:**

* `solution.cpp` — C++ implementation.


class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if(p==NULL && q==NULL){
            return true;
        }
        if(p==NULL || q==NULL || p->val!=q->val){
            return false;
        }
      return isSameTree(p->left,q->left) && isSameTree(p->right,q->right);
    }
};
